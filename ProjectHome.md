**Nai Sumit** is a project on language software. Focus is on Mon language; a living language using by more than 8,000,000 people around the world, especially in Burma and Thailand. Mon is an Austro-Asiatic language, the same family with Khmer, Vietnamese, Wa and Lawa. The language is very rich in vocabularies and culture.

Originally, Nai Sumit is a dedicated English volunteer teacher in Thailand. He was teaching English to Mon migrant workers in Mahachai between 2008 to 2011. And then he turned to writing and programming for Mon language; that's the starting point for this project.
